Welcome to ctSuite!
Please find below the attached instructions on running this.
By default, proxy-checker.py is disabled as it currently runs for a long time, due to it's single-threaded state.

It can be manually run with 'python3 proxy-checker.py', or 'python proxy-checker.py' depending on your runtime enviroment.

The GUI can be found in @\ctSuite-Frontend\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1\ctSuite-Frontend.exe
It must remain in this location, as it's dependencies and code library is present here.

For best results, you can run:
manual-run.bat should give you the best results if you have GUI issues.

Following this, and the required user input, if you let the scripts run and begin login checking, it should eventually come to completion at the login details:
